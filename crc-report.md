# Credit Risk Classification Report

## Overview of the Analysis

This project uses logistic regression to classify loan applicants as either low-risk (0) or high-risk (1). The goal is to help financial institutions make informed lending decisions. The model was trained on previous lending data with a sample size of over 15,000 borrowers. It considered a borrower's loan size, interest rate, income and debt-to-income ratio, any derogatory marks on their account, and total debt. 

## Results

- **Accuracy:** 0.99
- **Precision:** 0.89
- **Recall:** 0.89

## Summary

The logistic regression model is incredibly effective at predicting the credit risk of a prospective applicant given the variables included in the dataset. Given its 99% Accuracy and 89% Precision, this model can be a valuable tool for screening loan applicants at financial institutions.
